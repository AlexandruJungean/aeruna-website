        Aeruna crafts small‑batch, cold‑processed bar soaps with a focus on minimal formulas and
        sensorial pleasure. We prioritize high‑quality oils, gentle surfactants, and essential oil
        blends that elevate daily rituals. Our design language is quiet and airy—letting ingredients
        speak for themselves.
